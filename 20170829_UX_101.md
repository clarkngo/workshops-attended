1. What is UX Design?
Positive change for user

UX is not in the product, its in you. It’s the experience. Impact or emotional appeal. Decision-making with empathy.

Think about your product you use?

How did you get here?

Did you notice establishments or signs?

Snapchat glasses

Having a physical object adds complexity to UX design.

Make a seamless experience.

How can designers enhance the experience.

Creating a different mood.

Sense of order. Make it accessibility to the user.

Balance customer needs and business needs.

Lot of thought process to make it organic and intuitive.

Trend now is looking for generalist designers. Multi-facet makes the work not dull for UX designers.

PEOPLE ARE IRRATIONAL
- UX Design is process, not art.
- Depends on the intention
- Thinking of yourself, its an art. If for others, It is design. Its solving a problem for others.

Design process is not linear.

Design problem

Make a statement of the problem, first. Clarify, etc.

User persona
- Sets of characteristics that form a specific person.
- Data is the source of the design.
- Different personas for different pool of customers.

Think of user problems process.
- User flow (chart). Share to other departments.
- Then content buckets.
- After simple user flow diagram. Create user flow diagram with layouts.
- Prepare for all user scenarios.

WIREFRAMES
- Low fidelity designs. Like user flow diagram plus UX design.
- Balsamiq and Omnigraffle
- Illustrator, axure.
- Instructor’s favorite. Sketch.
- Don’t fix if it ain’t broke, use conventional for tried and tested already.
- With phones layout.

50 milliseconds for customer’s attention.

Keep it uncluttered, keep it simple.

Human minds are cognitively lazy.

REFINING
- Adding more visuals.
- Encourage to prototype more often.

Blue and green palette for wide range of customers.

Enough breathing room between elements. White spaces.

PROTOTYPING
- Flinto – best integration
- Invision – easiest to learn, they store information on their cloud. Strong design community. Look up DESIGN DISRUPTORS
- Axure - 
- Proto.io – synced with sketch
- Principle – synced with sketch
USER INTERVIEWS
- guide and not control. Tone and body language matters. Open-ended questions.
