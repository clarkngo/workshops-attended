# Workshops Attended
Welcome to my personal notes on workshops attended. 

When I moved in Seattle and started my computer science undergraduate bridge program with City University of Seattle, I was hungry to learn more on technology. Asking for advice from my professor, he said go to meetup.com and look for tech meetups. 

Since mid-2017, I found one meetup after another.

It lead me to explore the Seattle tech scene.
